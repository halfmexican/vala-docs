# Vala Documentation

This is the source code repository for the Vala Documentation website.

You can view the website online here: https://docs.vala.dev/

## Requirements

- python3
- pip (for Python 3)

You'll also need to install Sphinx and other dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file:

```sh
pip install --user --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

## Getting started

1. Build the website with:

```sh
./build-docs
```

Note: You may need to make the `./build-docs` script executable first:

```sh
chmod +x ./build-docs
```

2. In the `build` directory, open a html file in your favourite web browser. `index.html` contains the home page.

3. Whenever you want to rebuild the site with changes you make in `source`, repeat step 1.
